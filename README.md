# Multi-Style Image Generation with Semantic Image
### This project provides the source code for the research paper "Multi-Style Image Generation with Semantic Images." Our work focuses on developing a multi-style image generative network capable of efficiently producing high-quality images with diverse artistic styles based on semantic images. 

## Key Features:
- Efficiently generates high-quality images with different artistic styles based on semantic images
- Faster result generation compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Enables arbitrary style transfer with high resolution (512x1024)
- Utilizes a multi-channel generative adversarial network with reduced parameter count
- Consists of a content feature extraction network, style feature extraction network, and content-stylistic feature fusion network
